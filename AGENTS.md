# AGENTS.md

Project-level guidance for AI coding assistants (Cortex Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.) working in this repository.

## Repository Overview

Cortex Code skills that deploy routing, fleet intelligence, and geospatial analytics on Snowflake — powered by the OpenRouteService (ORS) App on Snowpark Container Services (SPCS).

Skills live in `.cortex/skills/`. Each is a self-contained deployment playbook an AI agent follows step-by-step.

## Repository Structure

```
.cortex/skills/              # All Cortex Code skills
  ├── <skill-name>/
  │   ├── SKILL.md           # Skill definition (frontmatter + instructions)
  │   ├── references/        # Detailed SQL, code, docs (loaded on demand)
  │   └── assets/            # Notebooks and other deployable artifacts
  ├── evals/                 # Eval framework (trigger, quality, xref)
build-routing-solution/      # ORS app build artifacts (Dockerfiles, configs)
docs/                        # Documentation (dev/ and guides/)
archive/                     # Archived materials
```

## Build, Test, and Lint

```bash
# Run skill evals (trigger accuracy, quality checks, cross-ref validation)
python3 .cortex/skills/evals/run_evals.py

# Audit a single skill interactively
# Invoke the skill-optimiser skill in Cortex Code: "audit skill <name>"

# Validate ORS services are running
snow sql -q "SHOW SERVICES IN DATABASE OPENROUTESERVICE_APP;"
```

No global build/lint step — each skill is independently deployable via its own SKILL.md workflow.

## Skill Conventions (Quick Reference)

For the full rule set, read `.cortex/skills/skill-optimiser/SKILL.md` and its `references/` directory. That skill encodes all conventions from "The Complete Guide to Building Skills for Claude" (Anthropic, Jan 2026).

Key rules:
- Folder name: **kebab-case**, must match `name` in YAML frontmatter
- Main file: exactly `SKILL.md` (case-sensitive). No `README.md` inside skill folders.
- Description: under **1024 chars**, formula: `[What] + [When] + [Triggers] + [Do NOT use for]`
- Body: under **5,000 words**. Move detailed content to `references/`
- No XML angle brackets in frontmatter. No "claude" or "anthropic" in skill names.
- Cross-skill references use full relative paths from repo root:
  ```
  > Read and follow `.cortex/skills/routing-customization/SKILL.md`
  ```
- Subskills nest as child folders; parent SKILL.md acts as a router
- All skills use `metadata.author: Snowflake SIT-IS` and `metadata.version: 1.0.0`
- Deployment skills must include `depends_on` in frontmatter listing prerequisite skills
- Deployment skills must include a `## Configuration` table with parameterized defaults
- Deployment skills must include a `## Required Privileges` table (no ACCOUNTADMIN assumptions)
- Deployment skills must include a `## Cleanup` section with DROP statements

## Error Logging

When any step fails or produces unexpected results (SQL errors, missing objects, wrong row counts, service failures, deployment issues), log the issue to `logs/` following the format in `logs/README.md`. Create one log file per execution: `<skill-name>_{YYYY-MM-DD}_{HH-MM}.md`. Continue execution where possible, logging all issues encountered. If execution completes with no issues, do not create a log file.

## Friction Logging

**MANDATORY:** After every `build-routing-solution` execution (regardless of success or failure), generate a friction log in `logs/`. This is NOT optional — every run produces a friction log, even if everything went smoothly.

File name: `friction-log_{YYYY-MM-DD}_{HH-MM}.md`

Follow the friction log template in `logs/README.md`. The log must capture:
- Exact wall-clock duration of each step
- Any friction points (confusing instructions, slow operations, unexpected behavior)
- **For each friction point:** what was done to resolve it during this run, and a recommendation for how to prevent it in future runs (e.g., skill wording change, new validation step, default change)
- A step-by-step status table showing OK/FAILED/SKIPPED for each workflow step
- Final summary with total execution time and overall outcome

If no friction was encountered, the log should still be created with "No friction points" and the step timing table.

## Creating a New Skill

1. Create folder: `.cortex/skills/my-new-skill/`
2. Create `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter + body (use `skill-optimiser` for the template)
3. Add `references/` for detailed SQL/code if body would exceed 5,000 words
4. Add `assets/` for notebooks or other deployable artifacts
5. Audit: invoke `skill-optimiser` or run `python3 .cortex/skills/evals/run_evals.py`
6. Update the Skills Inventory table above

## Do NOT

- **Inline large SQL blocks in SKILL.md** — put them in `references/*.md` and link
- **Skip the query tag** — every skill must set the session query tag for attribution tracking:
  ```sql
  ALTER SESSION SET query_tag = '{"origin":"sf_sit-is-fleet","name":"oss-<skill-name>","version":{"major":1,"minor":0},"attributes":{"is_quickstart":1,"source":"sql"}}';
  ```
- **Skip the object COMMENT** — every CREATE statement must include a COMMENT tracking tag (or `ALTER ... SET COMMENT` for CTAS):
  ```sql
  COMMENT = '{"origin":"sf_sit-is-fleet","name":"oss-<skill-name>","version":{"major":1,"minor":0},"attributes":{"is_quickstart":1,"source":"<sql|notebook|app>"}}';
  ```
- **Assume ORS is running** — always verify with `SHOW SERVICES IN DATABASE OPENROUTESERVICE_APP;` (all 5 services must be RUNNING)
- **Hardcode city/region** — skills must be configurable via parameters, not baked-in coordinates
- **Add README.md inside skill folders** — all docs go in SKILL.md or `references/`
- **Duplicate conventions** — point to `skill-optimiser` references instead of repeating rules
- **Require ACCOUNTADMIN** — document minimum privileges in `## Required Privileges`; never assume ACCOUNTADMIN
- **Skip cleanup instructions** — every deployment skill must have a `## Cleanup` section with DROP statements
- **Create any Snowflake object or run any query without tracking tags** — this is a hard requirement with no exceptions. Every new Snowflake object (TABLE, VIEW, PROCEDURE, FUNCTION, STAGE, SCHEMA, DATABASE, WAREHOUSE, TASK, DYNAMIC TABLE, STREAMLIT, SERVICE, AGENT) MUST have a COMMENT tracking tag. Every SQL session MUST set `query_tag` before executing statements. This applies to all skills, notebooks, stored procedures, dynamic SQL inside procedure bodies, ORS control app server code, and any other code path that creates objects or runs queries. For objects created via CTAS or dynamic SQL, use `ALTER ... SET COMMENT` immediately after creation. For service functions (`SERVICE=...` clause) that do not support COMMENT, document the limitation and ensure the parent procedure has a COMMENT tag.

## Control App Image Deployment (ors_control_app)

When changing any source file (`src/`, `server/`, or config), rebuild and push the Docker image.
The multi-stage `Dockerfile.runtime` compiles both the React frontend and the server automatically —
no manual `dist/` or `dist-server/` edits are needed.

**IMPORTANT:** Always use `Dockerfile.runtime` (multi-stage build). Never create a "prebuilt" Dockerfile that copies `dist/` from the host — this conflicts with `.dockerignore` and creates fragile host-build dependencies. The `.dockerignore` intentionally excludes `dist` and `dist-server` because the multi-stage build generates them inside the container. Do not remove those exclusions.

**ARM Mac + Podman:** If `esbuild` crashes with a QEMU segfault during the build stage, build locally first (`npm run build && npx tsc -p tsconfig.server.json`), then use `--ignorefile .dockerignore.prebuilt` when building the image. See `references/troubleshooting.md` for full instructions. Do NOT rename or edit `.dockerignore`.

```bash
APP_DIR=.cortex/skills/build-routing-solution/openrouteservice_app/services/ors_control_app

snow spcs image-registry login -c <connection>
REPO_URL=$(snow spcs image-repository url OPENROUTESERVICE_APP.core.image_repository -c <connection>)

# 1. Edit source files only:
#    - src/components/...  (React frontend)
#    - server/index.ts     (Express backend)

# 2. Build (bump version from current):
docker build --platform linux/amd64 \
  -f $APP_DIR/Dockerfile.runtime \
  -t $REPO_URL/openrouteservice_app/core/image_repository/ors_control_app:vX.Y.Z \
  $APP_DIR

# 3. Push:
docker push $REPO_URL/openrouteservice_app/core/image_repository/ors_control_app:vX.Y.Z

# 4. Update version:
#    - $APP_DIR/ors_control_app_service.yaml (image tag)

# 5. Upload updated spec to stage:
snow stage copy $APP_DIR/ors_control_app_service.yaml \
  @OPENROUTESERVICE_APP.CORE.ORS_SPCS_STAGE/services/ors_control_app/ \
  -c <connection> --overwrite

# 6. Apply new spec and restart:
# IMPORTANT: ALTER SERVICE while RUNNING does not reliably cycle the container.
# Always use the suspend → update spec → resume pattern to guarantee the new image loads.
```sql
ALTER SERVICE OPENROUTESERVICE_APP.CORE.ORS_CONTROL_APP SUSPEND;

ALTER SERVICE OPENROUTESERVICE_APP.CORE.ORS_CONTROL_APP
  FROM @OPENROUTESERVICE_APP.CORE.ORS_SPCS_STAGE/services/ors_control_app/
  SPECIFICATION_FILE = 'ors_control_app_service.yaml';

-- The service does NOT auto-resume after a spec update. Always resume manually:
ALTER SERVICE OPENROUTESERVICE_APP.CORE.ORS_CONTROL_APP RESUME;
```

# 7. After the service restarts, always retrieve and display the endpoint URL:
```sql
SHOW ENDPOINTS IN SERVICE OPENROUTESERVICE_APP.CORE.ORS_CONTROL_APP;
SELECT 'https://' || ingress_url AS control_app_url
FROM TABLE(RESULT_SCAN(LAST_QUERY_ID()))
WHERE name = 'ors-control-app';
```

Deploy order (top → bottom). Teardown order (bottom → top).

## Common Patterns

- **ORS dependency**: most demo skills require 4 running ORS services. Use `routing-prerequisites` to verify.
- **Overture Maps POI data**: fleet skills use Overture Maps for realistic locations. Fallback: synthetic points within configured bounding boxes.
- **ORS Control App deployment**: Edit source → `docker build` (multi-stage, no manual dist/ step) → `docker push` → update YAML version → `snow stage copy` spec to stage → `ALTER SERVICE FROM @stage SPECIFICATION_FILE=...`.
- **Object tracking**: Two tracking mechanisms — session `query_tag` (tracks queries) and object `COMMENT` (tracks created objects). Both are required. For CTAS (`CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT`), use `ALTER TABLE ... SET COMMENT` after creation since CTAS doesn't support inline COMMENT.
- **REBUILD_GRAPHS management (Issue #59)**: Routing graphs are persisted on `@ORS_GRAPHS_SPCS_STAGE/<region>/` and MUST be reused across suspend/resume cycles. The `create_region_ors_service` proc probes the stage and sets `REBUILD_GRAPHS="false"` if graphs already exist. After first-time provisioning completes (`service_ready=true`), `PROVISION_REGION_WRAPPER` auto-calls `SET_REBUILD_GRAPHS_FLAG(region, 'false')` so the next resume is instant (~1–2 min). For forced rebuilds (PBF update / corruption), call `REBUILD_REGION_GRAPHS(region)`.
- **AUTO_SUSPEND_SECS invariant**: While a region is being provisioned (`REGION_PROVISION_JOBS.STAGE IN ('DOWNLOADING','CONFIGURING','STARTING_SERVICE','WAITING_FOR_SERVICE','BUILDING_GRAPH')`) or an H3 matrix job is running (`MATRIX_BUILD_JOBS.STATUS IN ('PENDING','RUNNING')`) the relevant services (`ORS_SERVICE_<REGION>`, `routing_gateway_service`, `downloader`) MUST have `AUTO_SUSPEND_SECS=0` so automatic time-based suspension cannot interrupt the long-running work. At all other times they MUST be `AUTO_SUSPEND_SECS=14400` (4h). Every procedure that flips these values to `0` is responsible for restoring `14400` on ALL exits (happy path, timeout, early return, exception). The idempotent safety net `OPENROUTESERVICE_APP.CORE.RECONCILE_AUTO_SUSPEND()` detects drift and can be called at any time; it is auto-called by `SUSPEND_ALL_SERVICES` and `SUSPEND_SERVICE`.

## Geospatial Conventions

### GEOGRAPHY-First Schema Design
- Store point locations as `GEOGRAPHY` columns (not separate FLOAT lat/lon).
- Construct via `ST_MAKEPOINT(longitude, latitude)` — note: **longitude first**.
- Line/polygon geometries: use `TO_GEOGRAPHY('LINESTRING(lon lat, ...)')` or `ST_MAKELINE`.
- Keep redundant FLOAT lat/lon only when required (CLUSTER BY, ORS ARRAY_CONSTRUCT API args, bounding-box configs).

### Preferred Functions
| Instead of | Use |
|---|---|
| `H3_LATLNG_TO_CELL(lat, lon, res)` | `H3_POINT_TO_CELL_STRING(geography, res)` |
| `HAVERSINE(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2)` (returns km) | `ST_DISTANCE(geog_a, geog_b) / 1000` (meters→km) |
| `ST_DISTANCE` + filter | `ST_DWITHIN(geog_a, geog_b, meters)` (uses spatial index) |
| Separate FLOAT lat/lon in WHERE | `ST_WITHIN`, `ST_INTERSECTS`, `ST_CONTAINS` |

### H3 Index Storage
- Always store H3 indices as `VARCHAR` (string format, e.g. `'8928308280fffff'`).
- Use `H3_POINT_TO_CELL_STRING` (returns VARCHAR directly) — not `H3_LATLNG_TO_CELL` which returns NUMBER.
- Never cast H3 between NUMBER and STRING at query time — store as string from the start.

### Loading GEOGRAPHY Data
- **COPY INTO with transform**: use `ST_MAKEPOINT($col_lon, $col_lat)` or `TO_GEOGRAPHY($col_wkb)` in the SELECT.
- **INSERT via SELECT…UNION ALL**: compute `ST_MAKEPOINT(lon, lat)` inline (VALUES clauses cannot contain function calls).
- `MATCH_BY_COLUMN_NAME` cannot be used when adding computed columns — switch to explicit transform SELECT.

### Direct GEOGRAPHY Column References
All tables are created with GEOGRAPHY columns from the start. Reference them directly:
```sql
t.POINT_GEOM    -- telemetry point
t.ORIGIN        -- trip origin
t.DESTINATION   -- trip destination
```

### deck.gl Layer Selection
| Layer | Data format | Extraction |
|---|---|---|
| `ScatterplotLayer` | `[lng, lat]` array | `ST_X(geog)` / `ST_Y(geog)` in SQL |
| `H3HexagonLayer` | H3 string index | `H3_POINT_TO_CELL_STRING(geog, res)` in SQL |
| `GeoJsonLayer` | GeoJSON string | `ST_ASGEOJSON(geog)::STRING` in SQL |
| `PathLayer` | coordinate array | `ST_ASGEOJSON(geog)` → parse coords client-side |

### When FLOAT lat/lon is Acceptable
- ORS function arguments (`ARRAY_CONSTRUCT` of numeric coords for DIRECTIONS/MATRIX)
- Bounding-box configs (REGION_REGISTRY, city provisioner)
- `CLUSTER BY` expressions (GEOGRAPHY not supported in CLUSTER BY)
- Direct deck.gl `getPosition` callbacks expecting `[Number, Number]`
